This is a chance for people to learn and practice Scottish Country Dancing together using entirely gender-neutral language.

We will be dancing on **Thursday, October 3rd.**

- 7:00 - Advanced dance for people who already know SCD
- 7:30 - Lesson and practice for ALL
- 8:00 - Social dance, cued to the floor level
- 9:00ish - We're done! Go home, or maybe we grab snacks somewhere down the road?


Cost is **pay-what-you-can, $5 - $20** is the recommended donation.

This week will be recorded music, but hopefully in the future we will be able to pay live musicians a fair wage to play for us! MCing and teaching will be provided by Kat Dutton!

We are dancing in the **NESFA clubhouse**, located at **504 Medford St., Somerville, MA** It's about a third of a mile from the Magoun Sq green line station. There is a parking lot in the back.
The floor is linoleum, so bring clothing and shoes that you are comfortable dancing in.

**COVID PROTOCOLS**: Because wastewater data is showing levels above 500 copies/mL, we will be MASK REQUIRED for this dance. Please wear a well-fitting high-filtration mask over your nose and mouth.

Next dances:
- October 17th
- November 7th
