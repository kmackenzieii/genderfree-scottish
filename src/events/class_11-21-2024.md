Title: GenderFree SCD
Date: 2024-11-21 19:00:00

The schedule will be approximately as follows, but with lots of flexibility depending on who arrives when and wants to dance what (with who --we already know why!):
- 7:00 - Warm-up dancing for people who already know SCD (dances walked, but not taught in depth)
- 7:30 - Lesson and practice for ALL
- 8:00 - Social dance, cued to the floor level
- 9:00ish - We're done! Go home, or maybe we grab snacks somewhere down the road?

This week will be recorded music, but hopefully in the future we will be able to pay live musicians a fair wage to play for us! MCing and teaching will be provided by **Kat Dutton**!

(***Bonus***: *Do you know a musician who is experienced in playing SCD tunes --or wants to become so? Please get in touch!*)

*COVID PROTOCOLS*: Because wastewater data has been showing levels below 500 copies/mL, we will be MASK RECOMMENDED for this dance. I strongly encourage people to bring and use a high filtration mask if possible, but it will not be a requirement to dance, and there may be dancers present who are unmasked.
